TODO

- Write a load/save method !!!!!


- training loop (validation vs random?)
- test loop (two networks -> win-percentage)



DONE:

- Shuffle allowed moves before calling getMove()
- Keep score of avg number of moves per game each epoch

- Random: play win-in-1 with 100% chance
- Make above optional for neural players
